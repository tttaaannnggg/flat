Design by Subtraction: Or, How to Maintain Perfect Tyranny

## The Tyranny of Negative Space: Ideology and Design as a Subtractive Process

### Conflict of Interest

**overview**: Design strategies / design thinking are primarily institution-facing, not user-facing, especially when applied at scale. Minimalism is a hegemonic movement aimed towards removing agency from the user and diffusing responsibility away from people and towards opaque structures such as algorithms and platforms.

Within the modernist push towards minimalism and universal communication, “good” design has come to represent a flattening of the reality behind our interfaces, systems, and politics. The act of removing “nonessential” elements is not simply a purification of form or the manifestation of some Platonic ideal. Rather, it is a reshaping of reality, one which holds as its preconditions the destruction of other possible forms. 

A common topic in design circles is the study of negative space, which delineates the space "around" a thing, whether the paper around one's marks in a drawing, or the gaps between the elements of a sculpture. Designers and artists often suggest that one prioritize negative space to the same degree as positive space. If one is to shape negative space, however, one's efforts are not applied simply to the object of one's labor, but also necessitate that one exert control over the space around the object. Robert Irwin would re-paint the white walls in galleries where he exhibited his art, and anti-gentrification activists would likely assert that the neighborhoods in which these galleries emerge become similarly whitewashed in the process.

If we examine the landscape that advertisement has created for us, we can find this principle at work. We begin with the need to sell a product or service, and 



Digital platforms and media ecosystems that exist in our world have been optimized to serve as funnels that stritate communities. “Filter bubbles” and targeted advertising claim to describe or delimit interest groups, but in reality, they create them. It is easier to flatten a group into a shape that can be marketed-to, or, in other words, easily understood and controlled.

Perhaps the same concept extends to even greater scales; Even a cursory glance at the USA's foreign policy would suggest that we "need" to create this "negative space" around us in order to maintain our lifestyles.


Historically, this is demonstrated in the postwar narratives of “good design” or the colonizing force of Helvetica, the white cube space of fonts; As a tool and process, design is easily able to disguise its shortcomings as cosmetic exercises or flexures of a restrained, Modernist ethos, which is especially pathological and sneaky. This is in addition to the fact that design is massively scalable and fluid, acting as a medium that interprets nearly every aspect of the world from singular objects to large-scale states and agendas. It is design that makes it possible to ‘flatten’ actors at the national, international, and planetary scales. 

### Platform Capitalism and the Extraction of Labor
**overview**: the seamlessness of platforms is a tool that enables them to extract labor from their userbases. algorithms and platforms are architectural manifestations of power that are meant to be taken as a ‘natural’ or inevitable endpoint, but serve to disguise the biases, violence, and exploitation that they perpetuate. All platforms are essentially mechanical turks.

Google is part of the “big four” along with Amazon, Facebook, and Apple. As the entity behind the most visited site in the world, it holds exceptional market dominance. Unsurprisingly, this power is used to reinforce Google’s monopoly on sectors of advertising and search engine technologies. One of Google’s most strategic acquisitions has included reCAPTCHA, a challenge-response test used to identify bots from humans during the creation of new accounts for various web services. reCaptcha is a powerful tool simply by fact that hundreds of millions of CAPTCHAs are solved each day. Google has picked up on the workforce potential for such a large swath of obligatory labor hidden in its services and has pivoted itself to fully take advantage of the resource. Instead of maintaining a budget to hire laborers to train its AI systems as employees of Google, the conglomerate has found a way to train its own AI models entirely for free. Their accelerationist solution spreads a blanket of involuntary, unpaid labor across its own enormous user database, splintering the act of classification and identification (processes vital to machine learning) into non-negotiable exercises before each log in (given that you have recently deleted your cookies). 

This effectively blocks users from using Google’s services until they provide unpaid labor. Though the act is small and takes less than a minute, the lump sum of millions of Google user doing this labor automates and improves the company’s other products at no cost to Google at all. 

This is a perfect example of wealth begetting wealth or a form of perfect tyranny where Google (the top percentile) own’s all of the user-base’s wealth while they are effectively used as serfs or slaves. 

This labor is not extracted by force, but is a byproduct of a structure that removes enough information to funnel users into behaviors that are useful to the institution.

All social networks essentially are made valuable by the labor that a user provides; the work is a reward in itself for most, though, for a few youtubers, there is also a monetary component. It is design that prevents us from seeing that our keystrokes, our uploads are the labor that produces all value in these platforms. (something about how social platforms become more valuable the bigger they grow / are useful at all because of network effects)

The main value that engineers at Google provide is the capacity to extract value from its visitors. However much value the 100,000 employees at Google may be able to provide through their direct brilliance and problem-solving capacities, they are ultimately useful only because their technologies leverage the labor expended by their userbase. Seven of Google’s properties have user counts of over a billion.

This is why platforms that offer “free” services, and do not manufacture or sell product are still valued so highly. Facebook, for instance, sits in the range of $400 billion USD.


For other datasets, Google has employed services similar to Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

Maybe mention the GDPR scandal last month with Google too...



### Scalable Violence

**overview**: Let’s think about war through the lens of subtractive design. Is murder at scale possible because of / facilitated by subtractive design thinking? Low resolution images and high-tech interfaces filter information in convenient ways for those who design systems that are aimed at killing.

“Ever step on ants and never give it another thought? That’s what you are made to think of the targets – as just black blobs on a screen. You start to do these psychological gymnastics to make it easier to do what you have to do – they deserved it, they chose their side. You had to kill part of your conscience to keep doing your job every day – and ignore those voices telling you this wasn’t right.”


Our 

-F-35 Helmet
Hyper designed objects such as the $400,000 F-35 helmet compresses six fields of vision into one ‘eye of god’, projecting a HUD of miniature iconography which can simultaneously track thousands of stationary and moving targets up to 1300km away. This projection of the fighter pilot’s surroundings filters and reduces the landscape in order to form an aestheticized and truncated worldview. Actors on the ground are not translated by name or unique qualities, they are minimized and subtracted from the landscape as blips on a superimposed map, further reinforcing symbolic-fictional representations of the real world as a tool to dehumanize it.

The material reality of the pilot’s view is dissolved into abstract geometry; targets are squares, or circles, or tetrahedrons, not flesh and blood. A grid is imposed as a hegemonic structure in space; it is a preview of the flattening that occurs under the blast of a JASSM missile, a conceptual structure that facilitates the reshaping of a real one.

-drone piloting 
Multiple accounts of the experiences of pilots of the MQ-1 Predator drone remark on the power of abstraction and the flattening that a poor image can provide. 

What is removed from the image that a drone sees? Humanity, daily lives, the youth of a 'military aged male', or the fear in his eyes. Everything is reduced to a monochrome, flat, featurelessness; a point on a screen; a blur upon which you only need center your reticle.

Reducing distractions and eliminating unnecessary data is a process of deciding what to look at; of designing our world. The designation of "military aged male' may appear at first to be a piece of information, but in reality, it is the removal of other information. 

### Designing a Dystopia

**Overview**: Subtractive design will not remain invisible. Our imagined dystopias are a sign that we are becoming critical of the clean seamlessness of minimal design and platform capitalism. Can we learn to see our current dystopia and resist it?

Cyberpunk dystopia was once imagined as a messy noir set, blade runners pushing through crowded streets, dirt and filth and noise and poverty, raining, always raining. This has not vanished, but our popular imagination has brought an alternative to the forefront; a beautiful, white, clean space, immaculately engineered and designed. An Apple product expanded to the scale of architecture, as in Black Mirror, or Westworld’s labs, or Ex Machina, is now a visual shorthand for the sort of modernist design that has promised to simplify our lives, but has delivered its promise in an inhuman, indifferent way.

This emotion originates in our relationships with the apps, platforms, and interfaces that currently exist in our lives. We understand, on a visceral level, that these things that are marketed to us as structures that provide us with more choice, more freedom, more power, are governed by chains of cause-and-effect that are opaque to us, that diffuse criticism to no particular actor or strategy, but to an algorithm or a platform, forces that exist beyond our capacity to resist or criticize.

It is in these moments that we recognize the inhuman imposed from within the objects and spaces that have been designed.
